Accessing Blocks {#block_access}
================

There are two things that are generated by block definitions - blocks
themselves, with their specific settings,
`Shapes <block_shapes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and rotations, and
`Block Families <block_families>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} which
are sets of blocks that are considered to be variations of the same
block.

If a block doesn\'t define a shape, or defines multiple shapes, then it
is made available as a full block via the uri `moduleName:blockName`,
where the *moduleName* is the id of the containing module or `engine`
for build in blocks. The *blockName* is the filename of the block
(ignoring the extension). It can also be requested in any shape by using
the uri `blockModule:blockName:shapeModule:shapeName`.

The engine provides an api to access blocks, the
:java`BlockManager <org.terasology.world.block.BlockManager>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. For example to get a stair pointing to the left from
`BirchTrunk.block` (defined in the core module), inject the block
manager:

``` {.java}
@In
private BlockManager blockManager;
```

And then access the block via its URI:

``` {.java}
Block block = blockManager.getBlock("core:BirchTrunk:engine:stair.LEFT");
```

This will lookup the block `core:BirchTrunk`, using the shape
`engine:stair` and use the block from this family which is rotated to
the left.

Note
:::

If a block has a shaped defined it can only be requested using the block
uri, and its shape is fixed.

For example, a ladder has always a shape of `verticalOffsetPlane`, as
defined in `ladder.block`.

``` {.none}
...
"shape": "engine:verticalOffsetPlane",
...
```

In this case it is not possible to get an `engine:stair` instance of the
ladder block.
