Quick Start
===========

If you are only interested in playing the game or hosting a server
without own development, you can switch directly to the
`Playing </playing/playing>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} section.

For smaller contributions, like small typo fixes or readme updates, you
can use the
`Light Workspace Setup<light_workspace_setup>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, based on GitHub tools and direct file editing.

More elaborated engine development or module development is better done
on a full workspace setup with a programming IDE. Terasology supports
either an `IntelliJ Workspace Setup <ide_intellij>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or an
`Eclipse IDE Workspace Setup<ide_eclipse>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

We also recommend to [introduce yourself on the
forum](http://forum.terasology.org/forum/contributor-introductions.7)
and/or `visit us on IRC </developerIntro/usingIrc>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and let us know what you would like to do. You can find
first issues to work on in the [engine issue
tracker](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues). The
[Bite-size](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/labels/Bite-size)
category bundles issues estimated for some hours of work.
[Mentor-size](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/labels/Mentor-size)
issues are doable in some weeks, with assistance from a casual mentor.

For a better understanding of the general ideas behind the core
architectures, the `Concepts </concepts/concepts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} section is worth a look. More detailed guides for special
topics are available in the
`Developer Guides </developing/developing>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} area.

Code conventions, the general contribution workflow on GitHub and
related topics are available in the
`Conventions and Workflow </workflow/workflow>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} section.
